# This is the secret key that authenticates API access to the device
# It is expected to be a base64-encoded 32-byte key
# You can simply pick one up from https://esphome.io/components/api/#api-key
# (it is locally generated onto your browser, so safe to use)
# Alternatively, you can generate one using:
#   openssl rand -base64 32
crayon_api_key: "<your_base64_encoded_32_byte_key_here>"
# This is the password used to update the device over WiFi, once it has been
# flashed a first time using a USB cable. Pick anything you like.
crayon_ota_password: "<your_ota_password_here>"
# These are the WiFi credentials used to connect the device to your local
# network. You can also set non-existing credentials here. Connection will
# then fail and the device will start a fallback hotspot instead (after 60
# seconds), where you can connect and set the correct credentials. There is a
# chance however that the incorrect credentials are restored and thus you lose
# connection to the network each time you reflash. For some reason, you cannot
# set empty credentials here.
